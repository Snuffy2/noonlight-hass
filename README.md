# Noonlight for HomeAssistant (Snuffy2)

This is a fork of the [Noonlight](https://noonlight.com) integration for HomeAssistant. The official version is on the [Konnected.io repository](https://github.com/konnected-io/noonlight-hass).

[Noonlight](https://noonlight.com) connects your smart home to local emergency services to help keep you safe in case of a break-in, fire, or medical emergency.

### Noonlight service is currently only available in the United States

## Changes from Official Repository

* Adds address information using the v1 API

* Add unique id to Switch

* Setup via Config Flow

## How it Works

Noonlight connects to emergency 9-1-1 services in all 50 U.S. states. Backed by a UL-compliant alarm monitoring center and staffed 24/7 with live operators in the United States, Noonlight is standing by to send help to your home at a moment's notice.

When integrated with Home Assistant, a **Noonlight Alarm** switch will appear in your list of entities. When the Noonlight Alarm switch is turned _on_, this will send an emergency signal to Noonlight. You will be contacted by text and voice at the phone number associated with your Noonlight account. If you confirm the emergency with the Noonlight operator, or if you're unable to respond, Noonlight will dispatch local emergency services to your home using the [longitude and latitude coordinates](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/basic/#latitude) specified in your Home Assistant configuration or an address you specify in the Noonlight configuration.

Additionally, a new service will be exposed to Home Assistant: `noonlight.create_alarm`, which allows you to explicitly specify the type of emergency service required by the alarm: medical, fire, or police. By default, the switch entity assumes "police".

**False alarm?** No problem. Just tell the Noonlight operator your PIN when you are contacted and the alarm will be canceled. We're glad you're safe!

The _Noonlight Switch_ can be activated by any Home Assistant automation, just like any type of switch! [See examples below](#automation-examples).

## Initial set up

Setup requires a U.S. based mobile phone number.

1. Ensure that your [longitude and latitude coordinates](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/basic/#latitude) are set accurately so that Noonlight knows where to send help.

1. Click the link below to set up a Noonlight account and authorize Home Assistant to create alarms on your behalf:

    * [Connect to Noonlight](https://noonlight.konnected.io/ha/auth)

1. Save the resulting YAML snippet. You will need to enter these details into Home Assistant when adding the integration.

### Configuration

* `Noonlight ID`: A unique identifier assigned to you when you complete the [initial setup steps](#initial-set-up)

* `Noonlight Secret`: A secret key associated with your id

* `Noonlight API Eendpoint`: The Noonlight API endpoint used when creating an alarm

* `Token Endpoint`: The OAuth endpoint used to refresh your Noonlight auth token (hosted by [Konnected](https://konnected.io))

* `Location Mode`: Choose between Latitude/Longitude or Address

#### If Latitude/Longitude:

* `Latitude`: Will default to Latitude in Home Assistant

* `Longitude`: Will default to Longitude in Home Assistant

#### If Address:

* `Address`: Street address

* `Address 2`: Apartment, suite, etc. (optional)

* `City`: City/town name

* `State`: Two-letter state abbreviation

* `Zip`: Zip code

## Automation Examples

### Notify Noonlight when an intrusion alarm is triggered

This example is using the [Manual Alarm component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/manual/)

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: 'Activate the Noonlight Alarm when the security system is triggered'
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: 
          - alarm_control_panel.ha_alarm
        to: 'triggered'
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.noonlight_alarm
```

### Notify Noonlight when a smoke detector detects smoke

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: 'Activate the Noonlight Alarm when smoke is detected'
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: 
          - binary_sensor.smoke_alarm
        to: 'on'        
    action:
      - service: noonlight.create_alarm
        data:
          service: fire
```
